* Elephander: Composable Error Handlers and Typehint Shenanigans

An assortment of utilities which are useful but potentially ill-advised.

** Installation

: composer install bettrlife/elephander

** Overview

*** class ErrorHandler

A mechanism for managing multiple error handlers and dispatching to them based
on the error's level and descriptive string.

*** class Exceptionizer

Turns PHP errors (and optionally warnings) into Exceptions.  Each error/warning
level has a specific exception type so you can easily catch exact error codes
and let the rest bubble up.  Integrates with ErrorHandler.

*** class TypeHintHandler

Gives you the ability to define non-class typehints and to convert function
arguments based on typehints.  Integrates with ErrorHandler.

*** class DynamicScope

Provides dynamically-scoped data.
