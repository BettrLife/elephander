* Elephander: The Terrible, Horrible, No-Good, Very-Bad PHP Library

An assortment of utilities which are useful but potentially ill-advised.

** class DynamicScope

Provides dynamically-scoped variables.

** class ErrorHandler

A mechanism for managing multiple error handlers and dispatching to them based
on the error's level and descriptive string.

** class Exceptionizer

Turns PHP errors (and optionally warnings) into Exceptions.  Each error/warning
level has a specific exception type for easy limited catching.  Integrates with
ErrorHandler.
